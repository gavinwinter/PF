                       <h>
                           Is the future of food fake?
                       </h>
                       <p>
                           With the world’s population set to grow from 6.8 billion to 9.1 billion by 2050, the toll that the planet will take to sustain that increase is a serious concern (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/466531a"><i>Nature</i></a>). High-tech methods for growing food in the lab are now being considered alongside the agricultural practices that have been perfected through ancient tradition.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          Just ask anyone who has gone vegan or vegetarian recently, and you will almost certainly hear a wide spread of reasons for why they have done so. The rationale they give may include some of the following: protesting the cruel treatment of factory farm animals, reducing environmental impact, health reasons, or simply, <i>The China Study</i>. These are all perfectly sound reasons to cut the meat (and animal products), but where does that leave the rest of us omnivores.

							Meatless Meat
					   </h>
					   
                       <p>
							A 200-billion-dollar industry, “meat” is by a long-shot the highest impact agricultural product by the pound (or kilo). If you examine the cow simply as a mini-factory that produces our food, it is quite inefficient: 26 pounds of feed and nearly two thousand gallons of water are required to yield one pound of beef <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/13/food-water-footprint_n_5952862.html">(check out this interesting HuffPo article for more stats)</a>, all the while cows spew out methane in the process. 
                       </p> 
                       <p>
                           There are two main alternatives to the more traditional, butchered meat: cell culture-grown meat and plant-based meat. Using cell lines to produce (outside of a cow) the meat we crave, companies like Memphis Meats, Finless Foods, and SuperMeat have strived to create a sustainable alternative meat with moderate success. Understanding the bovine metabolism, or how animals rearrange molecules from their own plant-based diet to yield the food we know of as meat, have informed how to engineer the best lab-grown “meat” cells. While prices are dropping for cell culture-produced meat, this lab-grown option is still a premium product that would be marketed toward die-hard meat lovers.
                       </p>
                       <p>
						   The plant-based meat alternatives might present a more cost-effective option. The initial breakthrough came out of a Stanford biochemistry lab, in which the link was made between classic meat flavor and heme, the iron-containing molecule in blood that gives it the characteristic deep red color. (If you have ever wondered why red meat leaves an after-taste reminiscent of blood in your mouth, this is why.) With an optimistic view to end use of animals in food by 2035, professor emeritus Pat Brown, the founder of Impossible Foods, conceived a way to extract heme from the roots of legumes. However, this extraction method presented a long-term sustainability issue since heme would be sourced from the soybean roots and turning large amounts of soil to harvest these roots would result in the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Since then, Brown went back to his origin as a molecular biologist and sought to harness the power of the molecular pathways in plant genes that express for the heme protein. These plant genes could then be transferred to yeast, which work as mini-factories producing heme. 
                       </p>
                       <p>
							However, meat is not just a slab of one uniform composition. It is an amalgamation of the sinewy-textured fibers of muscle meat, or the gelatinous texture of fatty meat. Impossible Foods’ R&D group is still tackling challenges with mastering the chemistry behind this complex texture and the hundreds of chemical compounds that activate olfactory senses and taste buds to create the perception of meat in the brain.of small desalination plants. And if you build a series of small desalination plants you could potentially select several different strategic locations. This way, you can have flexibility in the amount of capacity you are bringing online, and you can have flexibility in the location of that capacity you are bringing online.
                       </p> 
                       <p>
                           Like Tesla and SpaceX, Impossible Foods embodies not just a feat in technological innovation, but more importantly, it seeks to inspire a change. Except that change is not in a transformation in personal transport or exploration, but rather in the public perception of lab-grown foods, ultimately with the goal of minimizing agriculture’s footprint.
                       </p>

							How does it really stack up?
					   </h>
                       <p>
							Even in the U.S., with its voracious appetite for meat, about 65% of people are willing to try in vitro meat, but only about a third of people would be willing to eat it regularly as a substitute for real meat (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171904">PLOS ONE</a>). Recent food critics’ reviews of the Impossible burger have noted the meatless burger’s “suboptimal texture and dryness” and made it clear that it was distinguishable from a real meat burger (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/is-the-impossible-burger-the-meatless-future-of-meat-were-not-so-sure/">ARS Technica</a>), but Impossible Foods is admittedly still in the process of honing their product.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                            Either larger traditional food preparation companies are hedging their bets or sense a turning tide because they too are investing in alternative meat companies. Much like combustion-engine automobile manufacturers that have started putting out their own lines of clean electric vehicles, existing traditional food conglomerates may soon try to integrate alternative meat products into their packaged food products for mass consumption.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Technology has driven change in many aspects of our lives, but food, more than just fuel for the body, is the soul of many cultures around the world. This brings to bear an important question: what audience are these alternative meat products marketed to? Alternative meat companies must be focused on making meats that are better in every way (in terms of the ethical choices, health benefits, cost, and taste), rather than presenting an alternative meat that has numerous trade-offs. Many market experts have suggested that alternative meat has the potential to parallel the growth in popularity of plant-based milks. The alternative meat must be good in its own right, and alternative meat producers need to capitalize on this rather than trying to (unsuccessfully) imitate every nuanced texture and flavor that is the essence of real meat.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Careful in their use of artificial and engineered terms like <i>in vitro</i> meat that may be off-putting to consumers, many alternative meat startups have instead opted for the term “clean meat.” However, in a day in age where genetically-engineered and processed foods that stray away from the organic roots of agriculture are shunned, big challenges lie ahead for the marketing teams of these alternative meat startups. A shift in mindset is certainly required before we transition as a society to clean meat.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Aside from the enormous challenge of convincing the everyday consumer to regularly purchase and eat their product, this new industry also faces uncharted territory in terms of regulation. While not quite like the grim future presented in dystopian thriller <i>Soylent Green</i>, ethical questions for lab-grown meat remain. Generally, medical studies have shown that eating meat has shown higher trends in the production of carcinogenic compounds in your body, but which of the compounds in meat triggers this is still not well known. When playing the part of god, engineering the perfect slab of meat, how do we decide which part of it is bad for you and which compounds should be left out? For reasons not explicitly stated, FDA approval for this new domain of the food industry has lagged, as it questions the safety and testing of leghemoglobin in alternative meat.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Vertical farms, aquaponics, and low-tech agricultural practices have already proven their potential, but development of sustainable food products may also be a necessary mainstay for the impending population explosion in the coming decades.
