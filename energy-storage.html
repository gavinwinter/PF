                                Batteries themselves are as ubiquitous as the technology and devices they power. While grid energy storage is certainly not as sexy of a technology as Tesla’s fleet of electric vehicles (EVs), with their sleek lines and trims, crisp LEDs, and silent performance, grid storage is a piece of infrastructure that will sustain residential life and industrial sectors, serving as the critical missing link in the bigger picture of a future powered by intermittent renewable energy sources.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are several benchmarks that are generally set for batteries or other devices that can be used for energy storage. First, it is important to differentiate power from energy. Power is essentially a measure of <i>how quickly</i> a battery can deliver energy through discharge of the battery. Both metrics determine how well an energy storage system suits any given application. For instance, take the case of batteries for EVs. The 500+ mile range can be attained with a high energy density battery, but EVs must also achieve high enough power requirements to accelerate fast enough from a stop (usually the 0-60 mph time you see reported in <i>Car & Driver</i> for supercars). While there are numerous other characteristics of batteries that make them cycle, and keep cycling, cost remains the primary setback for engineers and scientists. The holy grail for EVs is $100/kWh, enabling the production of an economically viable EV, but matching this with range requirements has proven quite a technical challenge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While energy storage for electric vehicles will likely be limited to lithium-ion batteries because of their unmatched energy density and compactness, the space for possible energy storage technologies for grid storage is much vaster. There are a multitude of low-tech energy storage methods that include, but are not limited to: pumped hydro, compressed air, flywheels, and fuel cells. Currently, energy storage worldwide is dominated by pumped hydro (99% of total capacity) with compressed air at a distant second<sup>1</sup>, but such forms of mechanically stored energy depend on the limited efficiency of the pumping system and energy conversion method. Each of these technologies has one pitfall that does not allow it to be feasible for grid-scale energy storage, whether that be the system’s cost, efficiency, or a lag-time before energy is available. Unlike EVs, where a designer is constrained to the form factor of an automobile, grid energy storage could be placed in an empty field or other strategic location, where compactness is not an issue. However, grid systems should require little to no maintenance, and the degradation of lithium-ion technologies would limit their application with grid energy.

                                <h3>A123 Systems</h3>
                                <p><b>Founder:</b> Yet-Ming Chiang (founded in 2001)</p>
                                <p><b>Funding received:</b> Almost $1B in total</p>
                                <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> High-energy density Li-ion batteries for EV applications</p>
                                One of the OG lithium-ion startups, A123 garnered a lot of media attention when it first received major financial support from venture capital, federal grants, and the Recovery Act of 2009. Hopes (and expectations) were especially high after Tesla battery researcher and legend of the industry, Jeff Dahn, hailed A123 as having a very “impressive battery system” in its time for high power capability. A123 initially sought a committed, exclusive relationship with Fisker. Irrespective of Fisker’s readiness to deploy a fully-electric luxury automobile for which they were still trying to find high-end customers, there were several false starts with A123 recalling batteries and a net loss with each battery unit sold. In order to turn a profit, at least 50,000 battery packs would need to be sold to compensate for manufacturing facility cost. While A123 also had pending deals with GM to integrate A123’s battery systems into the GM Spark, most of the company’s resources were being dedicated to the failing prospect with Fisker. A123 eventually became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chinese auto-parts manufacturer Wanxiang, sparking dissent among a growing body of critics who were alarmed by the transfer of federally-funded intellectual property being transferred to a foreign entity. Nevertheless, manufacturing would now be done in China via an accelerated platform, and research would remain within the U.S. Despite A123’s failure to scale-up manufacturing independently, they were a driver for advancing GM’s own battery chemistry further.

                                <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Large format Li-ion batteries with a 10-year lifespan</p>
                                One of the other OG lithium-ion startups, Boston Power is now likely the largest lithium-ion “startup,” at least by volume of units sold. Their units were first designed as long lifetime batteries for HP and Asus computers. These battery chemistries in their time were closest to maturity and ready for full-scale commercialization, but are now comparatively outdated chemistries. Boston Power’s manufacturing division moved off to China soon after the company’s founding, following a similar trend to A123 and many other traditional li-ion startups partnering with Chinese manufacturing companies. Boston Power announced in 2015 that they dedicated significant resources in to supply 30,000 battery packs to Chinese EV manufacturers. Lampe-Onnerud went on to found Cadenza Innovation with some of the same R&D folks from Boston Power, focusing on modular batteries for EV applications.

                                <p><b>Founder:</b> Yet-Ming Chiang (founded in 2010)</p>
                                <p><b>Funding received:</b> $54.5M in total (excluding possible funding from an industrial partner)</p>
                                <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Low-cost manufacturing technology for Li-ion batteries; possibly indicating that they will soon dip below the $100/kWh threshold for widespread employment of grid energy storage</p>
                                After noting cost was the limiting factor for li-ion battery production, Professor Yet-Ming Chiang of MIT sought to tackle the time and cost issues that plague the conventional li-ion electrode-making process. By removing most supporting inactive materials, 24M sought to maximize the active material (energy-storing material). With fewer processing steps, and with each step being drastically, a modular manufacturing line would ease the process of scaling up. While they are currently in negotiations with a host of tentative industrial partners throughout Asia in the hopes of launching high volume manufacturing in 2018, 24M also advertises their role as an “Integrator,” potentially allowing them to license their manufacturing technology similar to how Intel Inside provides microprocessor manufacturing expertise for use in laptop products. 24M is eager to emphasize that their primary focus is on grid applications. Possibly learning lessons from A123’s forays with the volatile EV market, they are wary of the materials expenditures required to fabricate cells with higher energy density for this market.

                                <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> 5 minute fast charge for both phone and EV batteries</p>
                                StoreDot has received funding from Samsung to assist in developing the fast-charge function for phones, and received additional investments from Mercedes parent-company Daimler earlier in 2017 to develop batteries for their EV fleet. StoreDot employs a proprietary “multi-function electrode” that capitalizes on the synergy of all components to enable both high-power capability and high energy density for longer discharge times. StoreDot is planning to build its own gigafactory (on a 1 GWh production scale in comparison to Tesla’s 35 GWh scale), and expects to release their first product in 2020. Daimler’s main objective is to assemble these battery packs for use in their trucks, which would compete with the newly released work-horse Tesla Semi and Mitsubishi’s comparable low-cost model, but they also plan to employ the battery packs in the rest of their fleet from luxury to economy vehicles.

                                The nanostructured polymer electrolyte developed by Seeo enables high energy densities and reduces the possibility of electrolyte decomposition, an issue that typically leads to abbreviated battery lifetimes. An additional perk of the technology is the non-flammable nature of the battery since it is solid-state. While there have not been many press releases regarding how the company might be scaling-up production, representatives from Seeo did confirm that the company was acquired by Bosch in late 2015.

                                Silicon, an anode material of particular interest in recent years, could theoretically enable twice the energy density of the conventional anode material of graphite. (Tesla already uses a proprietary graphite/silicon blend of some sort in their own batteries.) However, most issues with silicon arise from drastic volume change upon cycling, which leads to pulverization of particles and short lifetimes of batteries. After research at Stanford University demonstrated a form of nanostructured silicon wire that enabled high energy density and longer lifetimes, Amprius was conceived to commercialize this technology. But, manufacturing of nanostructured silicon is no small feat, requiring very energy- and capital-intensive processes like chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which are typically reserved for electronics fabrication.

                                Adamant that the cost of li-ion batteries will reach a floor, a hard limit due to the raw materials cost, Professor Donald Sadoway of MIT sought to develop a molten metal battery with earth-abundant materials, harnessing the energy potential between two segregated liquified metals (picture oil and water in salad dressing). Unlike li-ion batteries which have a limited lifetime and susceptibility to degradation, Ambri’s liquid metal battery boasts a long lifetime of at least four years under heavy loads, and a 12-hour discharge time, sufficient to meet the demands of the grid. However, as is evident by the fact that Ambri’s batteries are not yet deployed wide and far, there have been significant roadblocks to commercialization, including issues with sealing of cells especially at sustained high temperatures. Following delays with commercialization, the company announced a lay-off of a quarter of its staff in December 2015.

                                Founded by Professor Jay Whitacre of Carnegie Mellon University, who previously developed batteries for NASA’s Mars rover missions, Aquion carries a vision of electrifying off-grid areas in developing countries with long-lifetime batteries. Made with readily-available materials such as stainless steel and a water-based electrolyte the batteries exhibit superior safety performance as well as the ability to manufacture the cell on packing equipment designed for food and pharmaceuticals. In addition, Aquion also made claims that their battery is capable of 5,000 discharge and charge cycles, which would approximately equate to a 10-year lifetime on the grid. Aquion initially found a niche market with small boutique grid operators in Napa Valley and Hawaii, but poor timing with the faster-than-anticipated fall of prices for competing li-ion battery, the small and limited market for specialized grid applications led Aquion to lay off most staff in March 2017 and file bankruptcy later in 2017. However, an affiliate of China’s Titans Energy Technology Group, saw the potential of Aquion’s technology because of its lower lifetime cost and purchased the company.

                                <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> High energy density lithium metal battery for specialized consumer devices applications</p>
                                SolidEnergy Systems has a vision of making batteries for drones that will provide wi-fi in remote areas. SolidEnergy will seek to further penetrate other parts of the consumer devices market with watches, smartphones, and wearable devices, but eventually hopes to step into the EV market. While lithium metal anode chemistries still have safety and recharge issues, they hold the promise of increased energy density (which is why you would want to use them for small devices that require a lot of energy). Lithium metal is a close cousin to li-ion in terms of battery chemistry and would be of comparable cost. To combat plating issues that lead to battery failures, SolidEnergy developed a proprietary hybrid electrolyte that protects the battery and ensures safety during use. SolidEnergy developed their technology with conventional li-ion manufacturing in mind to ease integration, and ironically enough, they signed a deal with A123 to use their old manufacturing line in Waltham, MA.

                                <h3>Baseload Renewables</h3>
                                <p><b>Founder:</b> Yet-Ming Chiang (founded in 2017)</p>
                                <p><b>Funding received:</b> $2M (as of yet raised by MIT Engine)</p>
                                <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Long-discharge, low-cost flow battery for grid</p>
                                MIT Engine, a startup accelerator for “tough tech,” announced the introduction of Baseload Renewables, founded by Chiang and former employees of both 24M and Aquion. Baseload Renewables makes the bold claim that the sulfur-based flow battery they are developing will be manufactured at a fifth of the cost of where li-ion is expected to plateau. This dramatic cost reduction is in part due to the sulfur feedstock for the flow battery, which is available at very low cost as a waste product of the oil and gas industry. The proposed flow battery would deliver significant quantities of energy over long discharge times that are currently limited to pumped hydroelectric power. Since flow batteries require large reservoirs of liquid, the size of these batteries would likely not be suited for applications other than for the grid. The technology is 3-5 years away from commercialization and deployment, according to Baseload Renewables, but they hope to partner with an already successful and mature manufacturer to accelerate the transition to market.

                                <b>Take-away 1:</b>
                                The long development time to reach manufacturing scale and slow advancements with li-ion have culminated in only gradual improvements with no huge leaps in innovation. With a multitude of start-ups, funding is distributed among them, but few of these startups receive enough funding to develop their own manufacturing lines. The odds seem stacked against clean energy. Furthermore, many of these startups taking deep dives with early-stage technologies that may have a lot of potential, follow similar trajectories: either they go bankrupt or acquire an industrial partner, often foreign, and often Chinese. In order to accelerate development to put a product on the market, they rush to integrate the battery technology into a conventional manufacturing line, further restricting potential developments and as a result stifling innovation. While the launching of so many startups may seem like a “shotgun approach” to next-gen energy storage, each new venture and step is very calculated, each generation of serial entrepreneurs tweaking their strategy based on previous shortcomings. Numerous technical challenges remain, but each technology must be taken through to commercialization or until funding runs dry to determine whether it is <i>the</i> breakthrough.

                                <b>Take-away 2: </b>
                                For better or worse, the Big Three (LG Chem, Panasonic, and Samsung) are taking only safe bets, making no radical changes in chemistry. This strategy is the result of: perceived risk in next-generation technologies and an already well-established (profitable) market for li-ion batteries with consumer devices such as mobile phones, drones, and toys. While the advantages of making a product at scale set in just above $12 million in revenue, several hundred million dollars is required to merely build the manufacturing plant capable of handling that level of volume. Herein, lies the paradox for clean energy: there is a significant gap that must be cleared by early-stage energy storage startups in order to simultaneously bring a product to market and scale up quickly enough to remain in the green. As a result, few early- and mid-stage startups can successfully bring a product to market and generate profit, while remaining fully independent from larger conventional cell manufacturers.
                            </p>
                                
                            <h>Limits of Li-ion</h>
                            <p>
                                The realm of li-ion is already at a high degree of maturity after numerous developments since 1980s in the consumer devices market. While there may be new cell components, conductive additives, and electrolyte development that improve the thermal stability and extend the battery’s lifetime by mitigating the degradation of cell materials, the fundamental chemistry will not change significantly. The cathode active materials are the key component of li-ion batteries for maximizing energy density, but they also contribute to a significant portion of raw material cost. As a result, li-ion batteries energy density is steadily approaching an upper limit, while cost is steadily approaching a lower limit. New cathode active materials with novel structures that enhance diffusion pathways and other fun stuff would be required to make any notable improvements in energy density, but significant work with theoretical and computational materials science have for the most part exhausted possibilities of new materials for li-ion storage and diffusion. Thus, there are not expected to be further <i>drastic</i> improvements in the power and energy able to be stored and delivered by this class of batteries.

                            <p>
                                While many of the startups highlighted previously in this article have demonstrated a proof-of-concept for a range of technologies at various stages of maturity, a large portion of mid-term academic research is focused on the higher energy density lithium-metal and sodium-metal battery chemistries. Much directed research is conducted in China and South Korea, which are also unsurprisingly manufacturing hotspots. Despite a big bump up in energy density, safety is the primary pitfall with lithium-metal batteries, and li-ion batteries have already raised significant concern with recalls, fires, and explosions, plaguing even big players in the industry like Tesla, GM, and Samsung. Research teams at universities and companies alike have pioneered solid-state electrolytes that could complement lithium-metal batteries by improving stability and safety.

                                Research Beyond Li-ion: Long-Term Outlook Flow batteries similar to those being developed by Baseload Renewables and other startups are capable of long discharge durations and can be relatively inexpensive, depending on their material feedstock. For this reason, they would be well-suited for stationary commercial and residential grid applications.

                                Flow batteries similar to those being developed by Baseload Renewables and other startups are capable of long discharge durations and can be relatively inexpensive, making them ideal for stationary commercial and residential grid applications. Several research teams have prototyped flow batteries with earth-abundant materials like iron and plant-derived substances, which would have minimal environmental impact even at scale.

                            <p>
                                In the realm of high energy density mechanisms that would parallel li-ion for EV applications, one research group from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is actively using theoretical and computational materials science to assist in materials discovery and understand possible energy-storage mechanisms (<a href="http://ceder.berkeley.edu/">Ceder Group</a>). Understanding of these fundamental thermodynamics will allow for determination of future possible energy storage chemistries.

                                Chemistries for uber high-energy density applications are certainly possible (often using nanotechnology), but only seem to be viable for niche applications like super-secret CIA drones or NASA spacecraft because they are cost-prohibitive. As many experts have mentioned , it will be a battery of choice since it is difficult to maximize all desirable performance benchmarks.

                                It is a safe bet to predict that lithium-ion or lithium-metal will be the preferred battery chemistry for EVs of the future, but the specific components used and manufacturing methods employed could be anybody’s guess. As for grid energy storage, a low-cost, long-discharge, high-reliability energy storage technology like a flow battery will likely enable the wind-/solar-powered, distributed grid networks that power engineers and blockchain strategists are dreaming up. If there is a hope for such systems replacing natural gas or coal power plants and for EVs replacing combustion engine vehicles, claims of sustainable green energy raise the question of these manufactured materials’ footprint. That is, where are these materials sourced from? Are they sourced ethically and from a long-term sustainable supply chain? What are the technical challenges in recycling and recovering rare-earth materials? These are all questions that will be addressed in an upcoming article.

                                Chief researchers driving development have their hand in early-stage development at many multiple ventures as they overcome roadblocks and emerge from bankruptcy; old manufacturing facilities from failed start-ups are re-purposed for new ones; funding is pieced together between federal grants, various consortia, venture capital, and in some cases multinational companies, each with their special interest and target application. Everything in this venture may seem hodge-podge, but one must recognize this space is not suited to the quick results that venture capitalists might be looking for in other areas like software or app development. Significant material investments and commitments must be made before a technology may even be deemed commercially viable, accounting for the ephemeral nature of many of these startups when funding finally runs out. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the answer does not lie in the U.S., maybe it is in China, where much of the funding and the drive is coming from. Even if novel research originated in the U.S., startups must follow the funding to stay afloat, regardless of the source, and the risk in execution often lies in scaling up manufacturing capability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From a birds-eye view, it can be almost frustrating to watch how slow things progress in this realm. Why can we not just mash up all the benefits of each technology (fast charge, long lifetime, etc.) in one neat package? Why is there no true universally-compatible drop-in for manufacturing lines? Why can we not combine the flexibility of a R&D startup with the streamlined efficiency and resources of a full-scale commercial company? It is a complex system with many variables and many approaches taken from different angles, but we must remain confident that the confluence of bright minds or at least one venture will realize and commercialize a worthy solution.
